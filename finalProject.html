        <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <h2>CostaCalc</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project, I have created a calculator program which I am calling <i>CostaCalc</i>.
                We were instructed to create a program that either benefits the user through entertaining them, 
                augmenting their learning experience or is helpful in day-to-day life. I decided on a calculator program 
                because it fulfills two of those categories. 
            </p>
            <p>
               To use the program, it is as straight forward as any other digital calculator. You start out by pressing 
                the buttons to type the number you want to input, although note that on this calculator it is limited to three 
                decimal places. You can then choose the operation you want to perform, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication 
                or division. With <i>CostaCalc</i>, you can continue to work with a number after you have pressed the equals button. 
                If you press one of the four basic operations or the raise to a power button, it will use your current answer in your 
                new problem. Otherwise, if you press a number button before you press an operation your past answer will be erased 
                and the calculator will function as it normally would. In addition to these functions, <i>CostaCalc</i> also has the ability 
                to solve sine, cosine and tangent functions. To perform those operations, you just need to press the respective button 
                before you input your number. Finally, <i>CostaCalc</i> also has a clear button, which will clear anything you may have 
                inputted so far. 
            </p>
